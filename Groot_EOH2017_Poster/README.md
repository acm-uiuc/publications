# Groot Poster for EOH 2017

Project Groot presentation for the Engineering Open House 2017. It was presented at the ACM@UIUC Office on March 10th and 11th 2017.


## Abstract
We introduce a novel framework for creating unified application/programmer interface (API) layers for the microservice architecture. We show that with this new framework, which called Arbor, we can allow a whole new class of developers, in particular, high churn development groups like college organizations, to create infrastructure in the microservice paradigm allowing them to continually update their software infrastructure, without significant additional documentation. We show the potential of this framework by introducing ACM@UIUCâ€™s new infrastructure, referred to as Groot.
